   THE QUESTIONS
   Every answer maps to an exact product. Lazar, 15 Sep: "every single section
   of the finder needs to be updated to exact and specific products so that
   everything is actually correct and so that they know and actually get the
   correct product no matter what they select." So the places are the
   brochure's own application list, the colours offered on each path are only
   the colours that strip is made in, and the recommendation is a lookup
   table (see RESOLVE below), not a score. There is no "somewhere else" any
   more: every place leads somewhere specific.
